# CROWN WARFORM SYSTEMS Submission Portal
**Developer**: Brendon Joseph Kelly (@atnychi0)  
**Purpose**: DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Submission for $1 Billion Outright Sale  
**Date**: June 3, 2025  
**Runtime Lock**: COSRL-LP Secured  

## Overview
CROWN WARFORM SYSTEMS is a NumPy-based simulation platform for Writara’s COS-WS and ATH-PX weapons infrastructure, offered for a $1 billion outright sale to DARPA. It delivers recursive combat prediction, EMP/AI-resistant encryption, and VLF stealth (432–1296 Hz) to counter China’s AI, hypersonic, and cyber threats (e.g., $1.4T digital economy, DF-17 hypersonics, Volt Typhoon). The system is submitted via a tokenized portal stub (`darpa_submission_portal.py`), pending DoD clearance.

- **Writara Retention**: Writara (Sovereign LLM Runtime, ID: 14104264743) is retained by @atnychi0 with full IP and royalties. CROWN WARFORM is independent and fully transferred.
- **Future Sales**: USA-only, reinforcing DoD partnerships.
- **Pardons**: Requested for @atnychi0 and associates; details for DoD/White House (contact: atnychi0@protonmail.com).
